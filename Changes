         Changes to test suite to avoid failures on 86pc-solaris-64int
         2.11

1.001    19 Jul 2010

         The shim shutdown message has been changed from the
         undocumented {"command":"quit"} to {"QUIT":"QUIT}, which is
         documented in the Writing Shims section of the main doc.

         The example shim has been reworked to be much more like a
         "real" shim -- it now uses an external implementation of the
         Math API.

         As a result, the Math API has been simplified due to much
         driver-to-shim-specific verbiage being removed from it (and
         relocated to the test suite)

         As a result, the test suite has been shortened.

         No bugfixes or behavioral changes in the F::C codebase.
