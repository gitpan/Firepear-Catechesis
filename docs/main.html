<h3>Design</h3>

<p>There are four components in the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>driver</em> program</li>
<li>The <em>watchdog</em> program</li>
<li>One or more <em>shim</em> programs</li>
<li>One or more <em>test script</em> files</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <em>driver</em> reads the <em>test scripts</em> and asks
  the <em>shim(s)</em> to evaluate the individual tests therein. It
  then checks the shim's answers against expected values, which are
  also contained in the test scripts.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>watchdog</em> listens for messages from the driver about its
  activities. If it does not hear from the driver within a certain
  time-frame, it attempts to kill the driver and any known shims
  before shutting itself down.
</p>
<p>
  The Catechesis distribution includes the driver and watchdog, which
  are written in Perl 5. One shim is needed for each implementation of
  the spec or API you need to test, and it should be written in the
  same language as your implementation.
</p>

<h3 id="run">Running Tests</h3>
<p>
  Tests are run with <code>catechist</code>, the included driver
  program. For complete documentation, see <code>'man
  catechist'</code> after installing Catechesis. The general form is:
</p>
<pre>catechist --shim SHIM [OPTIONS] TEST_FILE [TEST_FILE..]</pre>
<p>
  So to run the example suite from within the Catechesis distribution:
</p>
<pre>$ cd examples
$ ../bin/catechist --shim ./perl5_shim test_suite.txt</pre>

<h3 id="scripts">Writing Test Scripts</h3>
<p>
  Test script files contain <em>stanzas</em> of various
  types, <em>comments</em>, and blank lines. Leading whitespace is
  consumed before any other parsing is done, so scripts may be
  indented however is most readable.
</p>
<p>
  Lines which begin with a pound/hash are comments. There are no
  multi-line comments, and hashes inside a line are not recognized as
  comments.
</p>

<pre># this line is a comment and will be ignored
# so will this one
but this one isn't # and this text isn't either
</pre>

<h4>Stanzas</h4>
<p>
  Everything in a test script, except comments, must be contained in a
  stanza.
</p>
<pre>begin [type]
    [directive_name] [directive_value] 
end
</pre>
<p>
  Stanzas are delimited by lines with <code>begin</code>
  or <code>end</code> as the first word.
</p>
<p>
  Every stanza has a <em>type</em>, which is given on
  the <code>begin</code> line. There are two valid types of
  stanzas: <code>test</code> and <code>environment</code>.
</p>
<p>
Stanzas contain <em>directives</em>, which are instructions on what
should be done.
</p>


<h4>Directives</h4>
<p>
  The first word in a directive line is the directive
  <em>name</em>. The remainder of the line is the
  directive <em>value</em>. Values may span more than one physical
  line by ending lines with a backslash:
</p>
<pre>begin [type]
    directive1 all these words become the value of the "directive1" directive
    # the next directive spans three physical lines
    directive2 text \
               more text\
               still more text
end
</pre>
<p>
  The value of <code>directive2</code> would be 'text more text still
  more text'.
</p>
<p>
  Environment stanzas may contain two directives:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>plan</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies how many tests are intended to be run in this script. A
    plan must be given before a test stanza is encountered. If the
    actual number run does not match the plan, the script as a whole
    will be considered a failure.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>diag</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Causes its value to be printed as a diagnostic line in the TAP
    output stream
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Test stanzas may contain four directives, two of which are required:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>send</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Required. The JSON which will be sent to the shim, carrying
    instructions and data for the test.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>expect</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Required. The JSON which you expect to get from the shim after it
    has carried out the instructions contained in
    the <code>send</code> directive.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>desc</code></dt>
  <dd>
    A freeform text description of the test, which will be printed in
    the TAP output stream alongside the test result
  </dd>
  <dt><code>diag</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Causes its value to be printed as a diagnostic line in the TAP
    output stream
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The format of the <code>send</code> and <code>expect</code>
  directives are between you and your shim, so long as they are valid
  JSON and vivify into a hash/dictionary/object. You will likely want
  them to mirror your spec or API. See the
  example <A href="/catechesis/math.shtml">Math API</a> and the
  <a href="http://github.com/firepear/Catechesis/blob/master/examples/test_suite.txt">standard
  test script</a> for an example.
</p>


<h3 id="shims">Writing Shims</h3>
<p>
  Shims are uncomplicated. They are simple programs which form a thin
  interface between Catechesis and the implementation you are testing
  (hence: <em>shim</em>).
</p>
<p>
  They communicate with the driver simply by reading
  from <code>STDIN</code> and writing to <code>STDOUT</code>. They
  don't (and shouldn't) know anything about Catechesis. They should
  know only three things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The format of the JSON they will receive</li>
  <li>The format of the JSON they will send back</li>
  <li>How to use the implementation they are testing</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Remember that communication with the driver is via pipes, so your
  shim must ensure that its writes to <code>STDOUT</code> are
  unbuffered/autoflushed, or are manually flushed with every write. If
  this does not happen, deadlock will occur and the watchdog will kill
  the shim process and the driver.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, all shims should terminate execution when receiving a
  message that contains the key <code>QUIT</code> with a value
  of <code>QUIT</code>.
</p>
