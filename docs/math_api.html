<h3>The Math API</h3>
<p>
  This is a very simple API which specifies four mathematical
  operations and several modes of error handling. It is the model API
  for Catechesis examples.

<h4>Version</h4>
<p>
  This is version 1.001 of 18 Jul 2010.
</p>

<h4>Operations</h4>
<p>
  There are four valid operations:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>add</dt>
  <dd>
    Expects two integer operands. The operands
    will be added together and the result returned.
  </dd>
  <dt>subtract</dt>
  <dd>
    Expects two integer operands. The second
    will be subtracted from the first and the result returned.
  </dd>
  <dt>multiply</dt>
  <dd>
    Expects two integer operands. The operands
    will be multiplied together and the result returned.
  </dd>
  <dt>divide</dt>
  <dd>
    Expects two integer operands. The first
    will be divided by the second and the result returned.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>
  If an operand is missing, the message "Missing
  operand: <code>OPERATION</code> requires <code>X</code>
  but <code>Y</code> were found" should be returned.
</p>
<p>
  If an operand is not an integer where it is required to be, the
  message "Non-integer operand found: <code>OPERAND</code>" should be
  returned.
</p>
<p>
  If the second operand of a <code>divide</code> command is zero, the
  message "Division by zero is undefined" should be returned.
</p>
