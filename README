Firepear-Catechesis

Catechesis is a tool for executing language-agnostic test suites, like
tests for specifications which may have multiple implementations, or
tests APIs which need to be tested across multiple versions of an
implementation.

Instead of writing unit tests in a programming language, tests are
expressed as scripts. Each script contains one or more messages, with
each message having (at a minimum) a directive and an expected
response.

Catechesis produces TAP as output, so its results can be interpreted
by the existing body of tools which speak the format.

For more information on using Catechesis, see the website
(http://firepear.net/catechesis/) or the file ./docs/main.html
included in this distribution.
